## Nasty Surprises Wishlist

Ideas for unexpected twists to keep players on their toes:

- [ ] Enemies that split when killed
- [ ] Sudden speed changes (slowdown zones, speed boost zones)
- [ ] "Fake" powerups that debuff you
- [ ] Screen-flip moments (gravity reversal?)
- [ ] Bullet-reflecting enemies
- [ ] Enemies that appear from behind
- [ ] Environmental hazards (asteroids, laser gates)
- [ ] Decoy bosses

## Known Issues

## Notes

- Polish pass (pixel art, screen shake) is explicitly deferred to Phase 5
- Sound system (init-06) can be done in parallel with other features
- Boss fights (init-07) depend on having solid enemy and powerup systems first
